\subsection{Detailed Description}
This is an obsolete class. 

D\-O N\-O\-T use it.

The only reason it's still here, is to be sure that it is backward compatible. This class was taking care of initialization and cleaning up curlpp (also libc\-U\-R\-L) (it was calling curlpp\-:terminate() in his destructor). However, from now on, you do not need this class. Note that the removal of this class was done because it was raising some threading issues.

Old documentation of that class\-:

If you want to be sure that curlpp is cleaned up after you reached the end of scope of a specific function using curlpp, instantiate this class. This function call curlpp\-::initialize() in his constructor, so you don't have to call it by yourself, when you have decided to use it.

See curlpp\-::initialize(long flags) and curlpp\-:terminate() for more documentation. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following files\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
include/curlpp/c\-U\-R\-Lpp.\-hpp\item 
src/curlpp/c\-U\-R\-Lpp.\-cpp\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
