Embedded System Remote \hyperlink{classUpdater}{Updater}

Extreme lightweight package manager for updating applications on embedded sytems. It uses two enviroments for automatic and secure updating. It automatically starts a recover version in case of updating failure Also it delivers an option for a sanity check.

Applications are stored as Packages (see Packages.\-conf for example) Applications can be updated by Job files (see examples/ for example Job files)

Job files are tars which has to deliver a Job.\-conf file with defined Tasks in it (see Template.\-conf) Following Tasks are supported (Add, Update and Remove) New or update files has to be in a folder with their package name. One Job.\-conf can content multiply Tasks.

The \hyperlink{classEmSyRU}{Em\-Sy\-R\-U} downloads the given Job File and automaticlly checks the Packages versions and update them. A Report of the updating process is been uploaded back again.
